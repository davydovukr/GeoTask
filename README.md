This is the code of my functional tests as requested in the assignment.

I was aiming at writing the tests as plain as possible and up to my best understanding of how the 
application should function.

I'm using Selenium WebDriver and Java.

All tests are in the EVRA.java file.

TestHelper.java contains global methods which are used all across my application.

Page.java is a Page Object file which contains methods specific for the functionality under test.

Access credentials are stored in the Credentials.java file which I did not commit to github for 
possible security reasons.

I was quite challenged by the requirement of report generation. I have never done it before, and when I started 
investigating how it can be implemented, I realized it's going to take a lot of time. 
So I decided to go without report generation. I'm sure I can learn it later.
